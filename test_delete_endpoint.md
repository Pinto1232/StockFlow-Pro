# User Deletion Fix - Test Instructions

## Problem Fixed
The User Management page was showing a "user deleted" message but the user was still appearing in the table because:

1. **Frontend Issue**: The JavaScript was only removing users from the local cache (`mockUsersCache`) but not calling the API
2. **Backend Issue**: There was no DELETE endpoint for mock users (`/api/users/mock/{id}`)

## Changes Made

### 1. Added DELETE Endpoint (Backend)
**File**: `StockFlowPro.Web/Controllers/Api/UsersController.cs`
```csharp
[HttpDelete("mock/{id}")]
public ActionResult DeleteUserMock(Guid id)
{
    var user = _mockUsers.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == id);
    if (user == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }
    
    _mockUsers.Remove(user);
    return NoContent();
}
```

### 2. Updated Frontend Logic (Frontend)
**File**: `StockFlowPro.Web/Pages/ManageUsers.cshtml`

**Before**: Only removed from local cache
```javascript
// Remove from mock cache
const index = mockUsersCache.findIndex(u => u.id === userToDelete);
if (index > -1) {
    mockUsersCache.splice(index, 1);
    loadUsers(); // This would reload from server, showing the user again!
}
```

**After**: Calls API DELETE endpoint
```javascript
// Call the API to delete the user
$.ajax({
    url: '/api/users/mock/' + userToDelete,
    type: 'DELETE',
    success: function() {
        loadUsers(); // Now reloads from server with user actually deleted
        showSnackbar(`User "${userName}" has been deleted successfully.`, 'info');
    },
    error: function(xhr) {
        // Handle errors appropriately
    }
});
```

## How to Test

1. **Start the application**: `dotnet run --project StockFlowPro.Web`
2. **Navigate to User Management**: Login as Admin → Admin Panel → Manage Users
3. **Test Delete Functionality**:
   - Click "Delete" on any user
   - Confirm deletion in the popup
   - Verify the user disappears from the table immediately
   - Refresh the page to confirm the user is permanently deleted

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Before Fix**: User shows "deleted" message but remains in table after page refresh
✅ **After Fix**: User is deleted and permanently removed from both table and server data

## Technical Details

- **Mock Data Storage**: Uses static `List<UserDto> _mockUsers` in the controller
- **API Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/users/mock/{id}`
- **Response**: `204 No Content` on success, `404 Not Found` if user doesn't exist
- **Frontend**: Uses jQuery AJAX to call the endpoint and refreshes the table from server
