# 🔧 NuGet Restore Issue - RESOLVED

## ❌ **Original Problem**
```
error : Access to the path 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing.Tasks.dll' is denied.
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
The error was caused by:
1. **Multiple dotnet.exe processes** running in the background
2. **File locks** on NuGet package files preventing cleanup/restore
3. **Corrupted NuGet cache** from previous failed operations

## ✅ **Resolution Steps Applied**

### 1. **Process Cleanup**
- Identified 13 running dotnet.exe processes
- Terminated all background dotnet processes using `taskkill /F /IM dotnet.exe`

### 2. **Cache Cleanup**
- Cleared all NuGet caches: `dotnet nuget locals all --clear`
- Removed build artifacts: `dotnet clean`

### 3. **Fresh Restore**
- Performed clean package restoration: `dotnet restore`
- All 8 projects restored successfully

## 📊 **Results**
- ✅ **All projects restored successfully**
- ✅ **No file access errors**
- ✅ **Both package sources working** (nuget.org + GitHub packages)
- ✅ **Build artifacts cleaned**
- ✅ **NuGet cache refreshed**

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Package Sources Used:
1. **nuget.org**: `https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json` ✅
2. **GitHub Packages**: `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/Pinto1232/index.json` ✅

### Restore Performance:
- Domain.Tests: 19.32 seconds
- Application: 38.26 seconds  
- Application.Tests: 38.27 seconds
- Infrastructure.Tests: 38.57 seconds
- Infrastructure: 38.57 seconds
- Web.Tests: 38.94 seconds
- Web: 38.94 seconds
- 1 project was up-to-date

### GitHub Package Source Notes:
- Connection retries occurred for GitHub packages (expected behavior)
- No private packages currently published to GitHub repository
- Authentication working correctly with environment variables

## 🛡️ **Prevention Measures**

### To Avoid Future Issues:
1. **Close development tools** before major NuGet operations
2. **Use `dotnet clean`** before restore if issues occur
3. **Clear NuGet cache** if packages seem corrupted: `dotnet nuget locals all --clear`
4. **Check for running processes**: `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq dotnet.exe"`

### Quick Fix Commands:
```bash
# Stop all dotnet processes
taskkill /F /IM dotnet.exe

# Clear caches and clean
dotnet nuget locals all --clear
dotnet clean

# Fresh restore
dotnet restore
```

## 📈 **Current Status**
- **NuGet Configuration**: ✅ Fully operational
- **Private Packages Setup**: ✅ Ready for use
- **Package Restoration**: ✅ Working correctly
- **Development Environment**: ✅ Clean and ready

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
Your development environment is now fully operational. You can:
1. **Build your solution**: `dotnet build`
2. **Run tests**: `dotnet test`
3. **Publish private packages** to GitHub when ready
4. **Continue development** without NuGet issues
