## 🚀 How to Use Private Packages

### 1. Publishing Packages to GitHub
```bash
# Build your package
dotnet pack

# Push to GitHub Packages
dotnet nuget push "bin/Release/YourPackage.1.0.0.nupkg" --source "github"
```

### 2. Installing Private Packages
```bash
# Install from any configured source
dotnet add package YourPrivatePackage

# Or specify the source explicitly
dotnet add package YourPrivatePackage --source github
```

### 3. Restoring Packages
```bash
# Standard restore (uses all configured sources)
dotnet restore

# Clear cache if needed
dotnet nuget locals all --clear
dotnet restore
```

## 🛡️ Security Features Active

- ✅ **No hardcoded credentials** in configuration files
- ✅ **Environment variables** for sensitive data
- ✅ **Token with appropriate permissions** (read:packages, write:packages)
- ✅ **Files excluded** from version control (.env*, *.token, etc.)
- ✅ **Setup scripts** available for easy reconfiguration

## 📅 Maintenance Schedule

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Review token usage in GitHub settings
- [ ] Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Every 90 Days (Token Expiration)
- [ ] Generate new GitHub Personal Access Token
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Test package operations

### Before Production Deployment
- [ ] Use separate tokens for different environments
- [ ] Consider Azure Key Vault for production secrets
- [ ] Set up monitoring for package access

## 🔍 Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify your setup:

```bash
# Check package sources
dotnet nuget list source

# Verify environment variables
echo $env:GITHUB_USERNAME
echo $env:GITHUB_TOKEN

# Test package restoration
dotnet restore --verbosity normal

# Clear cache and test
dotnet nuget locals all --clear
dotnet restore
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication failures**: Verify environment variables are set
2. **Package not found**: Check source configuration and permissions
3. **Token expired**: Generate new token and update environment variables

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Restart development environment to load new environment variables
# Clear NuGet cache: dotnet nuget locals all --clear
# Verify token permissions in GitHub settings
```
